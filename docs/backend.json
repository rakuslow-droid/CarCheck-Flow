    "reasoning": "The recommended Firestore structure prioritizes Authorization Independence and Query-Aware Security Rules (QAPs) by using a hierarchical path for vehicles and denormalizing authorization context. \n\n1.  **Merchants Collection (`/merchants/{merchantId}`):**\n    *   Each `Merchant` document will reside in this top-level collection. To enable authorization independence, each `Merchant` document **MUST** include an `ownerId` field. This `ownerId` will store the Firebase Authentication User ID (`request.auth.uid`) of the user who manages this specific merchant. This allows for simple, robust rules like `allow read, write: if request.auth.uid == resource.data.ownerId`.\n    *   **QAP Support:** For listing, a client would query `merchants.where('ownerId', '==', request.auth.uid)`. Rules can then simply verify `request.auth.uid == resource.data.ownerId`, ensuring only authorized merchants are returned.\n\n2.  **Vehicles Subcollection (`/merchants/{merchantId}/vehicles/{vehicleId}`):**\n    *   `Vehicle` documents are structured as a subcollection under their respective `Merchant`. This hierarchical approach inherently links a vehicle to its managing merchant, aligning with the \"Continue Hierarchy for Nested Data\" mandate.\n    *   **Authorization Independence:** To prevent security rules from requiring a `get()` call to the parent `Merchant` document (which would break atomic operations and complicate debugging), each `Vehicle` document **MUST** denormalize the parent merchant's `ownerId` into its own `merchantOwnerId` field. This means the `merchantOwnerId` in a `Vehicle` document will hold the same Firebase Auth UID as the `ownerId` of its parent `Merchant` document. This allows authorization rules for vehicles to be evaluated solely based on data within the `Vehicle` document itself, e.g., `allow read, write: if request.auth.uid == resource.data.merchantOwnerId`.\n    *   **QAP Support:** For listing vehicles, a client can either query `merchants/{merchantId}/vehicles.where('merchantOwnerId', '==', request.auth.uid)` for a specific merchant, or use a Collection Group Query across all vehicles a user owns: `firestore.collectionGroup('vehicles').where('merchantOwnerId', '==', request.auth.uid)`. In both cases, the `merchantOwnerId` field in the `Vehicle` document allows the rule to operate on the document's own data, ensuring only authorized vehicle data is returned without complex server-side filtering."
